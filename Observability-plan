1. Key Metrics

Business-Level Metrics
-Total download requests
-Successful downloads
-Failed download attempts
-Expiry enforcement accuracy
-Feature usage rate

These metrics help measure adoption and reliability.

System-Level Metrics
-Request rate (requests per minute)
-Error rate (percentage of failed requests)
-Average response latency (ms)
-Service uptime percentage
-Health check response time

These metrics support operational monitoring.


2. Logging Strategy

The system should generate structured logs including:
-Timestamp
-Service name
-Request ID (correlation ID)
-Event type (success, failure, expiry event)
-Error classification

Structured logging enables:
-Faster incident investigation
-Root cause analysis
-Cross-service traceability


3. Health Monitoring

Each service exposes a /health endpoint.

Health states:
-Healthy
-Degraded
-Unavailable

These endpoints support load balancer decisions and traffic rerouting.


4. Alerting Thresholds

Alerts should trigger when:
-Error rate exceeds defined threshold (e.g., > 5%)
-Latency exceeds acceptable limits
-Expiry mismatches are detected
-Service health endpoint fails consecutively

Alerts enable early detection and proactive mitigation.


5. Product Owner Perspective

From a product ownership standpoint, observability ensures:

-Feature reliability aligns with business expectations
-Release quality is measurable
-Incident response is data-driven
-Stakeholders receive transparency during outages
Observability transforms the feature from a static capability into a measurable, controllable product component.
