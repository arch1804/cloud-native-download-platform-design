Objective

Define potential system risks, classify their severity, and establish controlled mitigation and rollback procedures to protect user experience and business continuity.

1. Risk Classification
High-Risk Scenarios
-Expiry enforcement failure allowing unauthorized access
-Database unavailability affecting download processing
-Sustained high error rate impacting user experience

Impact:
-Business rule violations
-Revenue risk
-User trust degradation
-Medium-Risk Scenarios
-Increased latency under traffic spikes
-Monitoring service degradation
-Temporary API gateway misrouting

Impact:
-Slower user experience
-Partial visibility into system health
-Low-Risk Scenarios
-Delayed metric reporting
-Minor logging inconsistencies

Impact:

Limited operational inconvenience


2. Failure Scenarios & Mitigation

2.1 Scenario: Download Service Failure

Mitigation:
-Activate feature toggle to temporarily disable new download requests.
-Notify stakeholders.
-Redirect users with fallback messaging.

2.2 Scenario: Expiry Validation Error

Mitigation:
-Temporarily disable expiry enforcement via toggle.
-Investigate database integrity.
-Restore correct enforcement logic before reactivation.

2.3 Scenario: Elevated Error Rate

Mitigation:
-Trigger alert.
-Scale service horizontally.
-Review recent deployment changes.


3. Rollout Strategy

To minimize production risk, feature releases should follow:
-Staged rollout (percentage-based release)
-Monitoring validation during rollout
-Predefined rollback criteria

Rollback triggers may include:
-Error rate exceeding threshold
-Latency spikes beyond SLA
-Health endpoint instability


4. Rollback Mechanisms
-Feature toggle deactivation
-Rolling deployment reversal
-Traffic rerouting
-Database snapshot restoration (if applicable)
-Rollback actions should prioritize:
-Business rule integrity
-User experience stability
-Data consistency

                                
5. Product Owner Perspective

From a product ownership standpoint, risk and rollback planning ensures:
-Responsible feature delivery
-Controlled experimentation
-Reduced operational disruption
-Clear communication during incidents

                                
Risk awareness is a critical component of scalable digital product engineering.
