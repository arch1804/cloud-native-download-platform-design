Background

Digital platforms increasingly offer temporary or conditional access to content (e.g., downloads, previews, trial features). These features must scale reliably across large user bases while maintaining clear business rules such as expiry enforcement, eligibility validation, and usage limits. As systems scale, architectural decisions around stateless services, observability, and failure isolation become critical to maintaining performance and reliability.


Core Problem

There is a need to design a cloud-ready download processing system that:
-Supports temporary content access with expiry enforcement
-Scales horizontally under increasing traffic
-Remains stateless for cloud deployment compatibility
-Provides clear monitoring and failure detection mechanisms
-Allows controlled rollout and rollback during production releases

Without proper architectural planning, such systems risk:
-Expiry enforcement inconsistencies
-Service degradation under load
-Limited observability during incidents
-Complex rollback procedures

Product Perspective
From a product ownership standpoint, the system must:
-Align technical design with business rules
-Ensure predictable behavior under failure conditions
-Support incremental feature rollout
-Provide measurable metrics for monitoring adoption and reliability
-Enable cross-functional collaboration between engineering and operations

The objective of this project is to define a conceptual, cloud-native architecture that addresses these requirements while remaining deployment-ready.
