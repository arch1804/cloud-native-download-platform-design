Product Requirements
1. Stakeholders
-End Users – Require reliable temporary access to downloaded content.
-Business Team – Requires usage metrics and scalable architecture for growth.
-Engineering Team – Requires clearly defined APIs, service boundaries, and non-functional requirements.
-Operations Team – Requires monitoring, observability, and controlled rollout mechanisms.

2. User Stories
Epic: Temporary Download Processing

User Story 1
As a user, I want to download content temporarily so that I can access it offline within a defined validity period.

User Story 2
As a user, I want expired downloads to be automatically invalidated so that access rules are consistently enforced.

User Story 3
As a product team, we want visibility into download success rates and failures so that we can monitor system health.

User Story 4
As an operations team, we want feature toggles to enable rollback so that we can mitigate production risk.

3. Functional Requirements
-The system must allow users to request temporary downloads.
-The system must enforce expiry timestamps.
-The system must validate eligibility before granting download access.
-The system must expose API endpoints for download operations.
-The system must provide health and metrics endpoints.
-The system must support feature toggles for controlled rollout.

4. Non-Functional Requirements
-The system must be stateless to support horizontal scaling.
-The system must support high availability.
-The system must provide observability through metrics and structured logs.
-The system must isolate service failures to prevent cascading impact.
-The system must allow controlled rollback in case of release failure.

5. MVP Definition

Version 1 will include:
-Core download request handling
-Expiry enforcement
-Basic monitoring metrics
-Health check endpoint
-Feature toggle capability

Out of Scope (V1):
-Advanced analytics dashboard
-Machine learning optimization
-Multi-region deployment

6. Acceptance Criteria (Sample)
-Download requests return success response when eligibility conditions are met.
-Expired downloads are inaccessible after timestamp.
-Metrics endpoint returns download success/failure counts.
-Health endpoint responds within defined threshold.

Feature toggle disables new download requests when activated.
